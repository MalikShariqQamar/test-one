Activity 1
What we'll be looking at is how you approach the following:

use of Git
knowledge of JavaScript API
component composition knowledge
CSS knowledge
Limitations
For this activity you can use either React, Vue or Angular
Do not use any CSS precompilers; plain CSS only
Do not use any UI component libraries
Use the default framework CLI builder (e.g. Create React App, Vue CLI, or Angular CLI)
Do not use any reactive stores (e.g. Redux, Vuex or NGRX)
Do not add any other dependencies (e.g Lodash)
What we'd like you to do:

Take the following data and format it into a table
Add toggles to sort by id, type and batter (both ascending and descending)
Add a text input to filter the data
Add a form to collect new baked goods
Make the elements look nice using CSS
Once you have completed the task, please push the repository into a public Git host (Bitbucket/Github/Gitlab) with a README.md with instructions on how to build and run the application locally.

For example:

/**
* get the value of the property
* @param {String} path - the object path ie. 'address.office.state'
* @obj {Object} the object
*/
function getValue(path, obj) {
...
}
